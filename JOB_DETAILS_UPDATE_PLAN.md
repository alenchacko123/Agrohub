# Job Details Page Update

I'll update the job-details.html to include:

1. ✅ **Sidebar** (matching job-portal-dashboard)
   - AgroHub logo
   - User profile
   - Navigation menu
   - Sign out button

2. ✅ **Cleaner Layout** (matching your image)
   - Green header with job title and stats
   - Two-column layout:
     - Left: Description, Requirements, Responsibilities
     - Right: Farmer details with action buttons

3. ✅ **Better Styling**
   - Cleaner checkmarks for requirements
   - Better spacing
   - Action buttons (Apply, Call, Save, Share)

The job-details.html already exists and fetches data from the database. I just need to add the sidebar structure to match the job portal dashboard.

Would you like me to:
1. Add the sidebar to job-details.html (to match job-portal-dashboard)?
2. Keep the existing functionality (fetches job from database)?
3. Update the layout to match your screenshot?

This will make the job details page consistent with the job portal dashboard!
